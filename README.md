3. Given a linked list and a positive integer k, rotate the list to the right by k places. 
For example, given the linked list 7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5 and k = 2, it should become 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7. 

### Medium 
4. You are given a huge list of airline ticket prices between different cities around the world on a given day. These are all direct flights. Each element in the list has the format (source_city, destination, price). 
Consider a user who is willing to take up to k connections from their origin city A to their destination B. Find the cheapest fare possible for this journey and print the itinerary for that journey. 
```
[
    ('JFK', 'ATL', 150),
    ('ATL', 'SFO', 400),
    ('ORD', 'LAX', 200),
    ('LAX', 'DFW', 80),
    ('JFK', 'HKG', 800),
    ('ATL', 'ORD', 90),
    ('JFK', 'LAX', 500),
]

```

5. Given an array of integers, return the largest range, inclusive, of integers that are all included in the array. 
For example, given the array [9, 6, 1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 11], return (8, 12) since 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are all in the array. 

### Hard 
6. Given a list of words, find all pairs of unique indices such that the concatenation of the two words is a palindrome. 
For example, given the list ["code", "edoc", "da", "d"], return [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3)]. 

7. You come across a dictionary of sorted words in a language you've never seen before. Write a program that returns the correct order of letters in this language. 
For example, given ['xww', 'wxyz', 'wxyw', 'ywx', 'ywz'], you should return ['x', 'z', 'w', 'y']. 

8. Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative. 
For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5. 

9. You are given an array X of floating-point numbers x1, x2, ... xn. These can be rounded up or down to create a corresponding array Y of integers y1, y2, ... yn. 
Write an algorithm that finds an appropriate Y array with the following properties: 
- The rounded sums of both arrays should be equal.

- The absolute pairwise difference between elements is minimized. In other words, |x1- y1| + |x2- y2| + ... + |xn- yn| should be as small as possible.


10. An 8-puzzle is a game played on a 3 x 3 board of tiles, with the ninth tile missing. The remaining tiles are labeled 1 through 8 but shuffled randomly. Tiles may slide horizontally or vertically into an empty space, but may not be removed from the board. 
Design a class to represent the board, and find a series of steps to bring the board to the state [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, None]]. 

11. We're given a hashmap associating each courseId key with a list of courseIds values, which represents that the prerequisites of courseId are courseIds. Return a sorted ordering of courses such that we can finish all courses.

## Amazon 

### Easy 
14. Given an array and a number k that's smaller than the length of the array, rotate the array to the
right k elements in-place. 

15. Consider the following scenario: there are N mice and N holes placed at integer points along a line. Given this, find a method that maps mice to holes such that the largest number of steps any mouse takes is minimized. 
Each move consists of moving one mouse one unit to the left or right, and only one mouse can fit inside each hole. 

16. Given a N by M matrix of numbers, print out the matrix in a clockwise spiral. 
For example, given the following matrix: 
```
[[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
 [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]

```

17. Given n numbers, find the greatest common denominator between them. 
For example, given the numbers [42, 56, 14], return 14. 

18. You are given a list of data entries that represent entries and exits of groups of people into a building. An entry looks like this: 
{"timestamp": 1526579928, count: 3, "type": "enter"} 

19. Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in faster than O(n) time.
Recall that a complete binary tree has every level filled except the last, and the nodes in the last level are filled starting from the left. 

20. Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods: 
- push(item), which adds an element to the stack
- pop(), which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)
Recall that a heap has the following operations: 
- push(item), which adds a new key to the heap

- pop(), which removes and returns the max value of the heap


21. Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent
repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would
be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A". 
Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits
and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid. 

22. A tree is symmetric if its data and shape remain unchanged when it is reflected about the root node. The following tree is an example: 
Given a k-ary tree, determine whether it is symmetric. 
```
        4
      / | \
    3   5   3
  /           \
9              9

```

23. Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array. 
For example, for the input [1, 2, 3, 10], you should return 7. 

24. Implement a stack that has the following methods: 
- push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
- pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
- max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
Each method should run in constant time. 

25. Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome. 
For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is
a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome. 

26. Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as 0101 or 111110, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a 0 in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to 1. 
Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters): 
```
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s

```

27. Given an integer N, construct all possible binary search trees with N nodes. 

28. Given a linked list, remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero. Print out the remaining nodes. 
For example, suppose you are given the input 3 -> 4 -> -7 -> 5 -> -6 -> 6. In this case, you should first remove 3 -> 4 -> -7, then -6 -> 6, leaving only 5. 

29. Write a function that takes a natural number as input and returns the number of digits the input has. 
Constraint: don't use any loops. 

### Medium 
30. Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water,
so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water. 
For example, this matrix has 4 islands. 
```
1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1

```

31. An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times. 
Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element
doesn't exist in the array, return null. 

32. At a popular bar, each customer has a set of favorite drinks, and will happily accept any drink among this set. For example, in the following situation, customer 0 will be satisfied with drinks 0, 1, 3, or 6. 
A lazy bartender working at this bar is trying to reduce his effort by limiting the drink recipes he must memorize. Given a dictionary input such as the one above, return the fewest number of drinks he must learn in order to satisfy all customers. 
```
preferences = {
    0: [0, 1, 3, 6],
    1: [1, 4, 7],
    2: [2, 4, 7, 5],
    3: [3, 2, 5],
    4: [5, 8]
}

```

33. Given a pivot x, and a list lst, partition the list into three parts. 
- The first part contains all elements in lst that are less than x
- The second part contains all elements in lst that are equal to x
- The third part contains all elements in lst that are larger than x
Ordering within a part can be arbitrary. 

34. Given a node in a binary search tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor. 
For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30. 
```
   10
  /  \
 5    30
     /  \
   22    35

```

35. Given an array of a million integers between zero and a billion, out of order, how can you efficiently sort it?
Assume that you cannot store an array of a billion elements in memory. 

36. Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple lines such
that each line has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't
break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words.
If there's no way to break the text up, then return null. 
You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there
is exactly one space between each word. 

37. Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array. 
For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we
would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86. 

38. Implement a bit array. 
A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of 1 or 0 at each index. 
- init(size): initialize the array with size

- set(i, val): updates index at i with val where val is either 1 or 0.

- get(i): gets the value at index i.


39. Given a string, find the length of the smallest window that contains every distinct character. Characters may appear more than once in the window. 
For example, given "jiujitsu", you should return 5, corresponding to the final five letters. 

40. How would you explain the difference between an API and SDK to a non-technical person? 

41. Given a linked list and an integer k, remove the k-th node from the end of the list and return the head of the list. 
k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list. 

### Hard

Suppose you have N men and N women, and each person has ranked their prospective opposite-sex partners in order of preference. 
```

    'andrew': ['caroline', 'abigail', 'betty'],
    'bill': ['caroline', 'betty', 'abigail'],
    'chester': ['betty', 'caroline', 'abigail'],
}

gal_preferences = {
    'abigail': ['andrew', 'bill', 'chester'],
    'betty': ['bill', 'andrew', 'chester'],
    'caroline': ['bill', 'chester', 'andrew']
}

```

43. There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase.
The order of the steps matters. 
For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways: 
- 1, 1, 1, 1

- 2, 1, 1

- 1, 2, 1

- 1, 1, 2

- 2, 2


44. Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters. 
For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb". 

45. Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than
one with the maximum length, return any one. 
For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". The longest
palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana". 

46. Given a sorted array arr of distinct integers, return the lowest index i for which arr[i] == i.
Return null if there is no such index. 
For example, given the array [-5, -3, 2, 3], return 2 since arr[2] == 2. Even though arr[3] == 3,
we return 2 since it's the lowest index.

### Easy 
47. Implement the function fib(n), which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, using only O(1) space. 

48. Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a
node is the sum of all values under a node, including the node itself. 
For example, given the following tree: 
```
  5
 / \
2  -5

```

49. A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return False.  
For example, given [-6, 0, 2, 40], you should return 2. Given [1, 5, 7, 8], you should return False. 

50. A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer: 
- if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2
- if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1 
It is conjectured that every such sequence eventually reaches the number 1. Test this conjecture. 

51. Given a binary tree, find a minimum path sum from root to a leaf. 
For example, the minimum path in this tree is [10, 5, 1, -1], which has sum 15.

and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed). 
Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table. 

54. Gray code is a binary code where each successive value differ in only one bit,
as well as when wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary spurious values during
transitions. 
Given a number of bits n, generate a possible gray code for it.

Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply: 
- Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

whose sums are the same. 
For example, given the multiset {15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}, it would return true, since we

96. Given an array of integers in which two elements appear exactly once and all other elements appear exactly twice,
find the two elements that appear only once. 
For example, given the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 6, 10], return 4 and 8. The order does not matter. 

97. You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where each element

98. Given a start word, an end word, and a dictionary of valid words, find the shortest transformation sequence from start to end such that
only one letter is changed at each step of the sequence, and each transformed word exists in the dictionary. If there is no possible transformation,
return null. Each word in the dictionary have the same length as start and end and is lowercase. 
For example, given start = "dog", end = "cat", and dictionary = {"dot", "dop", "dat", "cat"}, return ["dog", "dot", "dat", "cat"]. 

99. Given a number in Roman numeral format, convert it to decimal.

    'I': 1
}

```

compute the person's itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. If there are multiple possible itineraries, return
the lexicographically smallest one. All flights must be used in the itinerary. 
For example, given the list of flights [('SFO', 'HKO'), ('YYZ', 'SFO'), ('YUL', 'YYZ'), ('HKO', 'ORD')] and starting airport 'YUL',
you should return the list ['YUL', 'YYZ', 'SFO', 'HKO', 'ORD'].

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth
house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal. 

105. Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order
and an integer k, return the maximum profit you can make from k buys and sells.
You must buy the stock before you can sell it, and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again. 
For example, given k = 2 and the array [5, 2, 4, 0, 1], you should return 3. 

106. There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

- Right, then down

- Down, then right


107. A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving
the graph connected. For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected. 
Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can choose to represent the
graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list. 

108. Given a circular array, compute its maximum subarray sum in O(n) time. A subarray can be empty, and in this case the sum is 0.

109. Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive),
where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an
array using only swaps. 
It should run in O(N) time. 

110. Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element. 
For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing. 

111. Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b, return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0, using only mathematical or bit operations. You can assume
b can only be 1 or 0. 

112. In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on game results. 
A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a 2000-ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player. 

113. Given an integer n, find the next biggest integer with the same number of 1-bits on. For example,
given the number 6 (0110 in binary), return 9 (1001). 

114. Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number with all distinct digits. 
Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the secret code. For example, if the secret code were 123456, then a guess of 175286 would score two, since 1 and 6 were correctly placed. 
```
{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}

```

115. Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.

For example, given the set [3, 5, 10, 20, 21], you should return [5, 10, 20]. Given [1, 3, 6, 24], return [1, 3, 6, 24]. 

166. Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element in the new array is the number of smaller elements to the right of that element
in the original input array. 
For example, given the array [3, 4, 9, 6, 1], return [1, 1, 2, 1, 0], since: 
- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 3

- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 4

- There are 2 smaller elements to the right of 9

- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 6

- There are no smaller elements to the right of 1

Follow-up: given a mutable string representation, can you perform this operation in-place? 

168. Given an iterator with methods next() and hasNext(), create a wrapper iterator, PeekableInterface, which also implements peek(). peek shows the next element that would be returned on next(). 
Here is the interface: 
```
class PeekableInterface(object):
    def __init__(self, iterator):
        pass

    def peek(self):
        pass

    def next(self):
        pass

    def hasNext(self):
        pass

```

169. Given the sequence of keys visited by a postorder traversal of a binary search tree, reconstruct the tree. 
For example, given the sequence 2, 4, 3, 8, 7, 5, you should construct the following tree:

   / \
  3   7
 / \   \
2   4   8

```

    return flist

functions = make_functions()
for f in functions:
    f()

```

173. On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces. 
You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard.
Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1). 
- (0, 0)

- (1, 2)

- (2, 2)

- (4, 0)

```
[b 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[b 0 0 0 0]

```

174. You are given an array of nonnegative integers. Let's say you start at the beginning
of the array and are trying to advance to the end. You can advance at most, the number
of steps that you're currently on. Determine whether you can get to the end of the array. 
For example, given the array [1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1], we can go from indices 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5, so return true. 

175. You are given an array of length n + 1 whose elements belong to the set {1, 2, ..., n}. By the pigeonhole principle,
there must be a duplicate. Find it in linear time and space. 

176. Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place. 
Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue. 

177. Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed). 
For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them. 

178. Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked
only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked. 
Design a binary tree node class with the following methods: 
- is_locked, which returns whether the node is locked

- lock, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false.
Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.

- unlock, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false.
Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.


179. Given a binary search tree and a range [a, b] (inclusive), return the sum of the elements of the binary search tree within the range.

 / \ / \
2  4 6  10

```

180. Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a
string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree. 
For example, given the following Node class 
```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

```

181. You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure
that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later

For example, given the following table: 
```
cba
daf
ghi

```

Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication. 

186. We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of
inversions it has. Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] but i < j.
That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element. 
Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time. 

187. You are given a set of synonyms, such as (big, large) and (eat, consume). Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent. 
For example, the following two sentences are equivalent: 
- "He wants to eat food."

- "He wants to consume food."


188. Given a singly linked list and an integer k, remove the kth last element from the list. k is guaranteed to be smaller than the length of the list. 
The list is very long, so making more than one pass is prohibitively expensive. 

189. Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals.
If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them. 
For example, given the intervals [0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9], one set of numbers that covers
all these intervals is {3, 6}. 

190. Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 0]]

```

191. Given an array of numbers and an index i, return the index of the nearest larger number of the
number at index i, where distance is measured in array indices. 
For example, given [4, 1, 3, 5, 6] and index 0, you should return 3. 

192. The h-index is a metric used to measure the impact and productivity of a scientist or researcher. 
A scientist has index h if h of their N papers have at least h citations each, and the
other N - h papers have no more than h citations each. If there are multiple possible values
for h, the maximum value is used. 
```
[4, 0, 0, 2, 3]

```

### Hard 
193. Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k. 
For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since: 
- 10 = max(10, 5, 2)

- 7 = max(5, 2, 7)

- 8 = max(2, 7, 8)

- 8 = max(7, 8, 7)


194. Implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n,
and contain the following methods: 
- set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new
item, then it should also remove the least frequently used item. If there is a tie, then the least recently
used key should be removed.
- get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
Each operation should run in O(1) time. 

195. In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter
along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of
'A' on the path. 
Given a graph with n nodes and m directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then
return null. 
```
ABACA

```

196. Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k.
If such a subset cannot be made, then return null. 
Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.

Given N, write a function to return the number of knight's tours on an N by N chessboard. 

198. You're given a string consisting solely of (, ), and *. * can represent either a (, ), or an empty string.
Determine whether the parentheses are balanced. 
For example, (()* and (*) are balanced. )*( is not balanced. 

199. An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list.
Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both,
which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement
an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the
end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index. 
If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to get_pointer and
dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses. 

200. Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once,
find and return the non-duplicated integer.

201. PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page. 
More mathematically, suppose there are N sites, and each site i has a certain count Ci of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site Sj is defined as : 

202. Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself. 

203. Given a string, split it into as few strings as possible such that each string is a palindrome. 
For example, given the input string racecarannakayak, return ["racecar", "anna", "kayak"]. 

204. Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner: 
The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents: 
```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext

```

205. Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n,
and contain the following methods: 
- set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new
item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.
- get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
Each operation should run in O(1) time. 

206. Design a system to crawl and copy all of Wikipedia using a distributed network of machines. 
More specifically, suppose your server has access to a set of client machines. Your client machines can execute code you have written to access Wikipedia pages, download and parse their data, and write the results to a database. 
- How will you reach as many pages as possible?

- How can you keep track of pages that have already been visited?

- How will you deal with your client machines being blacklisted?

- How can you update your database when Wikipedia pages are added or updated?

210. A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues. It can be viewed as a list of elements written left to right such that three operations are possible: 
- push(x): add a new item x to the left end of the list
- pop(): remove and return the item on the left end of the list
- pull(): remove the item on the right end of the list.
Implement a quack using three stacks and O(1) additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or pull operation is O(1). 

211. The game of Nim is played as follows. Starting with three heaps, each containing a variable number of items, two players take turns removing one or more items from a single pile. The player who eventually is forced to take the last stone loses. For example, if the initial heap sizes are 3, 4, and 5, a game could be played as shown below: 
In other words, to start, the first player takes three items from pile B. The second player responds by removing two stones from pile C. The game continues in this way until player one takes last stone and loses. 
```
  A  |  B  |  C
-----------------
  3  |  4  |  5
  3  |  1  |  3
  3  |  1  |  3

  0  |  1  |  0
  0  |  0  |  0 

```

212. Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array
so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only
swap elements of the array. 
Do this in linear time and in-place. 

213. You are given a 2D matrix of 1s and 0s where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

232. A wall consists of several rows of bricks of various integer lengths and uniform height. Your goal is to find a vertical line going from the top to the bottom of the wall that cuts through the fewest number of bricks.

239. Blackjack is a two player card game whose rules are as follows: 
- The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
- The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed 21.
- The dealer must then hit if their total is 16 or lower, otherwise pass.
- Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding 21 is the winner.
For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between 2 and 10 counts as their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces count as 1.

### Medium 
310. The number 6174 is known as Kaprekar's contant, after the mathematician who discovered an associated property: for all four-digit numbers with at least two distinct digits, repeatedly applying a simple procedure eventually results in this value. The procedure is as follows: 
- For a given input x, create two new numbers that consist of the digits in x in ascending and descending order.
- Subtract the smaller number from the larger number.
For example, this algorithm terminates in three steps when starting from 1234: 
- 4321 - 1234 = 3087

- 8730 - 0378 = 8352

- 8532 - 2358 = 6174

337. reduce (also known as fold) is a function that takes in an array, a combining function, and an initial value and builds up
a result by calling the combining function on each element of the array, left to right. For example, we can write sum() in terms
of reduce: 
This should call add on the initial value with the first element of the array, and then the result of that with the second element of the array,
and so on until we reach the end, when we return the sum of the array. 
```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def sum(lst):
    return reduce(lst, add, 0)

```

338. Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time. 
It should contain the following methods: 
- set(key, value, time): sets key to value for t = time.

- get(key, time): gets the key at t = time.

```
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2

```

- check(value): Check whether a value is in the set.
The check method may return occasional false positives (in other words, incorrectly identifying an element as part of the set), but should always correctly identify a true element. 

343. You are given n numbers as well as n probabilities that sum up to 1. Write a function
to generate one of the numbers with its corresponding probability. 
For example, given the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] and probabilities [0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2], your
function should return 1 10% of the time, 2 50% of the time, and 3 and 4 20% of the time.

You can assume that all values get cleared at the end of the day, and that you will not be asked for start and end values that wrap around midnight. 

355. Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
Assume that each node in the tree also has a pointer to its parent. 
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v
and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).” 

356. A teacher must divide a class of students into two teams to play dodgeball. Unfortunately, not all the kids get along, and several refuse to be put on the same team as that of their enemies.
